# Slime
A slime simulation made in Processing 4


Inspired by these amazing works [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qryINYcgO1s), I wanted to do my own simulation


There are 2 key bindings:
    - 'r': set the agents parameters to random values
    - 'n': not only set the agents parameters like 'r' but reset their position too
